  Array Assignment
  
  The spread operator (...) allows you to easily place an expanded version of an array into another array. This is demonstrated in the example below...
  
  var list = [1, 2];
  list = [...list, 3, 4];
  console.log(list); // [1, 2, 3, 4]
  
  You can put the expanded array in at any position, and get the effect you'd expect:
  
  var list = [1, 2];
  list = [0, ...list, 3 , 4]
  console.log(list); // [0, 1, 2, 3, 4];
  
  Object spread
  You can also spread an object into another object. A common use case is to simply add a property to an object without mutating the original:

 const point2D = {x: 1, y: 2};
 // Create a new object by using all the point2D props along with z 
 const point3D = {...point2D, z: 3};
