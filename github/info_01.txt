Container and Presentational Components

1.- Difference between Container and a presentational Components, Statefull and Stateless components, or smart and dumb components. (same thing)
2.- What do they actually mean.

    Having a DOM TREE with a list of components 
    If we add a server to provide real data from an API, we immediately make the component a smart component. the smart component which is the container component essentially contains all the other components that do not know about the data however the smart component can then pass the data down to the child components. 


    SMART  / CONTAINER Components
    
    1.- Communicate with services and render child components

    Dumb / Presentational Components
    
    1.- Accept data via Inputs 
    2.- Emit data changes via event outputs
